            <h1>Kneatting Thread</h1>
            <p>In this Part we deal with how we can make clothes like skirts, <br>
                 caps,bags including school bags,laptop bags & women bags,... <br> this helps us 
                 to not sit with out work and intsead of going for <br> other things which are not important 
                 we sit down and do that <br>it also helps us to earn money and we can also buy for our selves <br>
                 any thing we want like airtime,under wears,... and increases and <br> expands our brain capacity of thinking new things
and creativity <br> even this is supported by the bible where we find that in the <br> prophetic classes they learnt to do different 
things with there hands <br> even Jesus was a carpenter and Dorcas who was famous she used <br>
 to knit cloths and also us as Ambassadors we shall not sit with out work.
